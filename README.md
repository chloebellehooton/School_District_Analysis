# School District Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for City School System has tasked me to help her prepare all standardized test analysis to look into performance trends and patterns. These insights will be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school. By analyzing data on student funding and standardized test schools, we can showcase trends in school performance to assist the School Board and Superintendent in making decisions for budgets and priority. 

After our initial analysis, we were notified that there was evidence of academic dishonestly with the reading and math hscores for the Thomas High School 9th graders. In order to uphold state-testing standards, we had to replace their math and reading scores with nulls and give a report on the updates.
